# C# SDET API Test Framework Project

## JPL API Testing

### Project Goal
* Producing a high quality API testing code in accordance to the Epics and Customer requirements.

### Definition of Done
* When the total work that has been created, meets the expected functionality and acceptance criteria of 
it's respective stories & epics.

#### Sprint 1
#### Goal: To create Service Object Model for the API and Write atleast one Unit test for each API present.

* To create Service Object Model
* Create seperate folder to interact with different API

#### Sprint 1 - Review

- List of backlog items that have been completed
- List of backlog items that haven't been completed
- Focusing on the apis that have more data to the them
- Potentially keeping mind of what the application could look like when there are more solutions rather than just the one
- Look towards testing the different data that comes back from the apis more explicitly
- Go into detailed tests on a request if it consists of one specific object


#### Sprint 1 - Retrospective

##### Start
- Increase level of communication
- Do more research on the APIs

##### Stop


#### Continue
- Smaller commits
- Keeping everyone informed
- Working independently

#### Action Points

#### Sprint 2
#### Goal: To create unit tests to cover many aspects of 'happy path' for the APIs present.

* To determine the main aspecs of the API and test them accordingly
* Continue to work within individual APIs to avoid conflict and error in code

#### Sprint 2 - Review

- Sprint Backlog items have been completed
- None hae been pushed back into project backlog
- Focussed on the api's happy path
- Potentially keeping mind of what the application could look like when there are more solutions rather than just the one
- Look towards testing the different data that comes back from the apis bad path
- 
#### Sprint 2 - Retrospective

##### Start
- Ensure User stories are added before the work is started

##### Stop
- Leaving the backlog empty

##### Continue
- Keep everyone informed
- Updated local branches before work

#### Sprint 3
#### Goal: To Create seperate projects for different API and do more tests for bad path

* To create seperate project inside a same solution for different file and have a common library to hold the data shared.
* Continue to work individually on Happy and bad paths.

#### Sprint 3 - Review

- Sprint Backlog items have been completed.
- None has been pushed back into the project backlog.
- Focussed on Creating the seperate projects for each API.
- Focussed on Bad path and happy path.

#### Project retrospective

#### What went well
- Communication between Team Mates.
- Worked well Independently and collaborating with others.
- Small Commits and frequent merges avoided conflict.
- Changing the scrum master helped distribute the workload.
- People were willing to provide assistance. 

#### What we could have improved
- More research into understanding the data of the API response.

#### What we could hae done with more Time
- Uniform tests across all API's.
- Worked on Scouts API.
- Making app.config global.
